Project Overview: Metro Line Helper

Purpose: The purpose of the application is to provide commuters with a convenient way to access information about the metro line, including stations, schedules, real-time updates, and more. It aims to streamline the commuting experience and make it easier for users to plan their journeys on the metro line.

Key Features:

Interactive Map: The application will feature an interactive map displaying the metro line route and stations. Users can pan and zoom the map to explore different sections of the metro line.

Station Information: Users can click on individual stations on the map to view detailed information about them. This includes the station name, location, amenities (e.g., wheelchair accessibility, parking facilities), nearby attractions, etc.

Train Schedules: The application will provide users with access to train schedules for the metro line. Users can view the departure times of trains from specific stations and plan their journeys accordingly.

Real-time Updates: Users will receive real-time updates on train schedules, delays, disruptions, etc. The application will notify users of any changes to their planned journeys and provide alternative routes if necessary.

Search Functionality: Users can search for specific stations or destinations using a search bar. The application will suggest relevant stations as users type, making it easier to find what they're looking for.

User Preferences: Users can customize their experience by setting preferences such as preferred stations, routes, notification settings, etc. This allows users to tailor the application to their specific needs and preferences.

Accessibility Features: The application will include accessibility features to ensure that it is usable by all users, including those with disabilities. This includes support for screen readers, keyboard navigation, high contrast mode, etc.

Responsive Design: The application will be designed to be responsive and accessible on a wide range of devices, including desktops, laptops, tablets, and smartphones. This ensures that users can access the application anytime, anywhere.

Additional Features (Optional):

Integration with Public Transit APIs: Integration with public transit APIs (e.g., GTFS feeds) to provide users with comprehensive information about the metro line, including connections to other transit services.

Trip Planner: A trip planner feature that allows users to plan their entire journey, including transfers between different modes of transportation (e.g., metro, bus, tram).

User Accounts: User accounts with features such as saved routes, trip history, favorite stations, etc. This allows users to save their preferences and access them across different devices.

Feedback Mechanism: A feedback mechanism that allows users to provide feedback on their experience with the application, report issues, suggest improvements, etc.

By implementing these features, the Metro Line Helper application will provide users with a comprehensive and user-friendly platform for accessing information about the metro line and planning their journeys efficiently. It aims to enhance the commuting experience for users and contribute to the overall efficiency and accessibility of public transportation systems.
